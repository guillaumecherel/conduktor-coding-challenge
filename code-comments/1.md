```java
@Transactional

// The method should have a more descriptive name like "sendBilling", and
// the parameter name should indicate what it represents, like "userInfo".
// It should also throw a more specific exception than "Exception" 
// if the function throws one (or several) that the application can recover from 
// (see below).

public HttpStatus doSomething(JsonNode data) throws Exception {
    JsonMapper mapper = new JsonMapper();
    JsonNode node = mapper.valueToTree(data);

    // If the node doesn't contain the field "billing_user", we will get
    // an NullPointerException since the method "get" below will return
    // "null".  
    //
    // If the application logic allows that a node doesn't have that
    // field, then the case must be dealt with, for example by having
    // the function return an Option[HttpStatus] that is None when the
    // field is not present.
    //
    // If the application logic requires that a node here always
    // has a "send_emails" field, and the absence is a programming error,
    // it may be a good idea to just throw a more specific unchecked error
    // like RuntimeError("'billing_user' field absent") so that future
    // programmers have a better clue of what's wrong when the program
    // evolves (for example, if in a subsequent version the field stops
    // being required by the application logic but we forget to fix it
    // here, the error will remind us).
    //
    // An even better approach would be to model the application logic
    // with types that would make it impossible for such a node to not
    // have a "billing_user" field. For example, a class User that has a 
    // billingUser member variable with a constructor "public
    // Optional<User> create(JsonNode userInfo)", that only returns
    // some User if "userInfo" has all the data required and None
    // otherwise. The User thus created are guaranteed to contain all
    // the fields that the application logic requires. The "unsafe code"
    // handling the outside world's messiness would then be localized in
    // the type constructors and that would help the programmers avoid
    // mistakes in the application logic code.

    String billingUserEmail = node.get("billing_user").asText().toLowerCase();
    Boolean sendEmail = node.has("send_emails") && node.get("send_emails").asBoolean(false);
    
    if (billingUserEmail.contains("@conduktor.io")) {
        emailService.call(sendEmail, billingUserEmail);

        // Does emailService.call always succeed? If not, it might be
        // a good idea to handle its return value or exceptions thrown
        // that could reflect network issues or other problems. For
        // example, if it returns an HttpStatus, return it rather
        // than HttpStatus.OK.

        return HttpStatus.OK;
    } else {
        return HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN;
    }
}
