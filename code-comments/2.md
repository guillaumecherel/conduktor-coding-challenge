```java
User user = this.userRepository.findByEmail(email).orElse(null);
if (user == null) {
    user = new User();
    Company company = this.companyRepository.findByName(companyName).orElse(null);
    if (company == null) {
        company = new Company();
        company.setName(companyName);
        //Save Company
        log.info("Adding Company");
        log.info(this.mapper.valueToTree(company).toPrettyString());
        company = this.companyRepository.save(company);
    }
    user.setEmail(email);
    user.setFullName(name);
    user.setCompany(company);
    user.setRoleId(null);
    user = this.userRepository.save(user);
}
```

This code excerpt optionnally constructs user and company values and updates
repositories. Values creation is done in a mutable manner, which is not safe:
for example, we can accidentally forget to set the email value for the user and
end up with a "user" that is not properly constructed. Value construction can be
done in an type safe manner by writing constructors that take as arguments the
data required, such as 

```java
class User {
  final String email;
  final String fullName; 
  //...

  public User(String email, String fullName, Optional<RoleId> roleId, 
     Company company) { 
     this.email = email;
     this.fullName = fullName;
     //...
  }
}

public class Company {
  //..

  public Company(String companyName) { 
     //... 
}
```

This would give us a higher type safety since the compiler would not allow us to
create a user without passing the email argument to the constructor function. 

Since we don't need to mutate the values anymore to construct them (like
`user.setEmail(email)`) we can make values immutable. Immutability makes easier
to reason about the program:Â the same expression means the same thing at
different parts of the code, we don't need to worry about values changing.

Repositories update necessarily entails mutating something. We can still benefit
from an immutable and type safe functional approach with such effectful code 
using a type like ZIO.
