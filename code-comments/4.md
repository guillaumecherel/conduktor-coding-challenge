```kotlin
class MyRunnable(val client: Client): Runnable {
    // Pending calls. This will be null only if the thread has shut down.
    private var pendingCalls: MutableList<Call>? = LinkedList<Call>()

    private val otherCalls = ArrayList<Call>()

    // ...

    override fun run() {
        log.trace("Thread starting")
        while (true) {
            // ...
            if (stoppingCondition) break;
        }

        var numTimedOut = 0
        val timeoutProcessor = TimeoutProcessor(java.lang.Long.MAX_VALUE)

        synchronized(this) {
            // pendingCalls is optional, but we know it can never be null here
            numTimedOut += timeoutProcessor.handleTimeouts(pendingCalls!!, "The thread has exited.")
            pendingCalls = null
        }
        numTimedOut += timeoutProcessor.handleTimeouts(otherCalls, "The thread has exited.")
        numTimedOut += timeoutCallsToSend(timeoutProcessor)

        if (numTimedOut > 0) log.debug("Timed out {} remaining operation(s).", numTimedOut)

        client.close();
        log.trace("Thread exited")
    }
}
```

This class seems to handle asynchronously some interactions represented by
the type `Call` with a single client, until a stopping condition is reached.
After that, it handles pendingCalls and otherCalls, probably to release
associated resources.

The cleanup phase after the while loop may not happen if the thread is
interrupted before it reaches the stoppingCondition, resulting in pendingCalls
that may not properly be closed. The client also normally closed at the end of
the `run` method will not be closed.

To handle resources like the calls and the client more safely, we could use 
java's `try / finally` construct, put the loop in the `try` block and all the
cleanup phase in the `finally` block.

Another, safer, option would be to attach each cleanup operation to its
corresponding event, such that for example each `Call` is attached to its own
cleanup phase, and ensure that it is executed when the event terminates. This
would be safer as it would reduce the risk that the programmer forgets to
cleanup some of the resources. This can be done with ZIO's functions
`ZIO.ensuring` or `ZIO.bracket`.
